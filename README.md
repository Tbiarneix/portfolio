# Thomas Biarneix's Portofolio


## Tecnhology

This portfolio has been made with Next 14 and highly inspired by Britanny Chiang.
Designed by my own and coded with module.css strategy.
It is deployed with Vercel.


## Ecoconception and accessibility

This project respect eco-conception and accessibility standarts.
I choose a dedicated typography Luciole to improve reading.
I'm still working on a dedicated accessibility module to offer a better experience.


## More to come

I have more and fun features to come.
